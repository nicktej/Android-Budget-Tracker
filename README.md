# android-budgettracker
This is an android budget tracker! I was inspired to create one when I was studying abroad in Hungary.

I created the budget tracker for everyday use, and it has features such as:
- data categorization
- data visualization (pie chart)
- currency converter
- emailing capabilities

Future ideas include:
- Refreshes every month, and emails automatically
- Update data categorization function (allow users to input their own categories, etc)
- Different visualizations and additional functions (can see previous months expenditure, etc)
- Improve UI design
