# Android Budget Tracker
This is an android budget tracker! I was inspired to create one when I was studying abroad in Hungary. The budget tracker allowed me to log and email my expenses to my parents every month. Prior to creating the application, I would always key my expenses on the phone before entering it onto my computer. As I was studying abroad in Budapest for a semester, the application I built
automatically converted the recorded transactions into US dollars, simplifying the conversion process. It
also allowed users to create visuals / charts of their expenditure. That was definitely one of the key moments
where I was encouraged to use my passion to create to solve an everyday problem.

I created the budget tracker for everyday use, and it has features such as:
- data categorization
- data visualization (pie chart)
- currency converter
- emailing capabilities

Future ideas include:
- Refreshes every month, and emails automatically
- Update data categorization function (allow users to input their own categories, etc)
- Different visualizations and additional functions (can see previous months expenditure, etc)
- Improve UI design

## Getting Started

If you're interested, all you have to do is fork the repo and enjoy!

### Prerequisites

You will need Android Studio, and an emulator or an Android device.

### Installing

The only thing to note after downloading this is that some parts might be outdated, and the program was built with a specific package. You should probably change the manifest file.
